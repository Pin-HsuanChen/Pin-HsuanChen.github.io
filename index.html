      <h2>About me</h2>

      <p id="bio">Hello! I’m Pin-Hsuan Chen. I earned my Ph.D. in 2023 under the guidance of Prof. <a href="https://www.ie.tsinghua.edu.cn/eng/info/1051/1008.htm" target="_blank">Pei-Luen Patrick Rau</a> at the Institute of Human Factors and Human-System Interaction, Department of Industrial Engineering, <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/" target="_blank"> Tsinghua University</a>. Before my doctoral studies, I completed a Master’s in Industrial Engineering at Tsinghua in 2019, following a Bachelor’s in Industrial Engineering and Management from <a href="https://iem.nycu.edu.tw/en/home/" target="_blank">National Chiao Tung University</a> in 2017.
        
      <p>I am currently a User Experience Engineer at <a href="https://www.dji.com" target="_blank">DJI</a>, which I joined in May 2025. My work focuses on user-centered interactions across both hardware and software of handheld cameras. Previously, I worked at <a href="https://www.liauto.com/#li" target="_blank">Li Auto</a> as a Product Manager, contributing to user experience initiatives in intelligent vehicle systems. During my time there, I explored human–AI interaction patterns and supported the development of AI-enabled cockpit experiences.</p>

      <p>At the heart of my work is a long-standing curiosity that has guided both my academic path  and my decisions in industry. I often pause and ask myself: “What do people think when they are with technology? How do they benefit from it? And how might technology truly support human well-being?” To explore these questions, I have become deeply interested in how cognitive behaviors and emotional states influence human performance. During my Ph.D., I examined EEG and behavioral data to understand these dynamics, hoping not only to learn how people use technology but also how technology can more thoughtfully respond to the human mind. </p>
      
      <h3>Inner Growth </h3>
      <p>Over the past year, I’ve come to understand myself with more clarity and calmness. 
I learned to listen to my own thoughts, accept my emotions as they are, 
and separate what is truly mine from what belongs to others. 
This shift didn’t happen all at once, but it has quietly changed the way I see 
relationships, decisions, and even how people interact with technology.</p>
      
      <p>Working on camera products made this even more meaningful. I used to be someone who couldn’t look at myself on screen,  
and I believe there is someone else in the world. If the products can help someone see themselves a little more gently, </p>
      <p>to notice, </p>
      <p>To appreciate, </p>
      <p>or even accept who they are…</p>
 
<p>I think that is a beautiful experience, emotionally as well as technologically. Isn't it？</p>
      
      <p>
A few books accompanied me through this journey and helped me put words to my reflections:
</p>

      <h3>Selected Research Projects</h3>
      <h4>Cognitive Behaviors of Boredom in Intelligent Interaction Workplaces</h4>
      <img src="/assets/images/r1.jpg" alt="r1">
      <p><br>We developed a smart homecare dashboard and collected brain signals (Electroencephalography) while participants were interacting with the dashboard. After that, we analyzed alpha oscillations in terms of brain regions to investigate the influence of boredom on cognition.</p>

      <h4>Boredom in Different Information-Processing Mechanisms in Prolonged Monitoring Tasks</h4>
      <img src="/assets/images/r2.jpg" alt="r2">
      <p>We collected brain signals while participants were monitoring smart homecare system with different processing mechanisms (top-down / bottom up). Then, we analyzed alpha power and alpha synchronization based on brain regions and hemispheres. In this way, we can further specify different cognitive responses when bored based on information processing mechanisms.</p>
