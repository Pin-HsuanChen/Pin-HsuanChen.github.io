      <h2>About me</h2>

      <p id="bio">  Hello! This is Pin-Hsuan’s corner. I think, I grow, I learn, and I find myself smiling a little more.</p>
      
      <p>I earned my Ph.D. in 2023 under the guidance of Prof. <a href="https://www.ie.tsinghua.edu.cn/eng/info/1051/1008.htm" target="_blank">Pei-Luen Patrick Rau</a> at the Institute of Human Factors and Human-System Interaction, Department of Industrial Engineering, <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/" target="_blank"> Tsinghua University</a>. Before my doctoral studies, I completed a Master’s in Industrial Engineering at Tsinghua in 2019, following a Bachelor’s in Industrial Engineering and Management from <a href="https://iem.nycu.edu.tw/en/home/" target="_blank">National Chiao Tung University</a> in 2017.</p>
        
      <p>I am currently a User Experience Engineer at <a href="https://www.dji.com" target="_blank">DJI</a>, which I joined in May 2025. My work focuses on user-centered interactions across both hardware and software of handheld cameras. Previously, I worked at <a href="https://www.liauto.com/#li" target="_blank">Li Auto</a> as a Product Manager, contributing to user experience initiatives in intelligent vehicle systems. During my time there, I explored human–AI interaction patterns and supported the development of AI-enabled cockpit experiences.</p>

      <p>At the heart of my work is a long-standing curiosity that has guided both my academic path  and my decisions in industry. I often pause and ask myself: “What do people think when they are with technology? How do they benefit from it? And how might technology truly support human well-being?” To explore these questions, I have become deeply interested in how cognitive behaviors and emotional states influence human performance. During my Ph.D., I examined EEG and behavioral data to understand these dynamics, hoping not only to learn how people use technology but also how technology can more thoughtfully respond to the human mind. </p>
      
      <h3>Inner Growth </h3>
      <p>Over the past year, I’ve come to understand myself with more clarity and calmness. 
I learned to listen to my own thoughts, accept my emotions as they are, 
and separate what is truly mine from what belongs to others. 
This shift didn’t happen all at once, but it has quietly changed the way I see 
relationships, decisions, and even how people interact with technology.</p>
      
      <p>Working on camera products made this even more meaningful. I used to be someone who couldn’t look at myself on screen,  
and I believe there is someone else in the world. If the products can help someone see themselves a little more gently, </p>
      <p>to notice, </p>
      <p>to appreciate, </p>
      <p>or even accept who they are…</p>
 
<p>I think that is a beautiful experience, emotionally as well as technologically. Isn't it？</p>
      
      <p>
A few books accompanied me through this journey and helped me put words to my reflections:

      <h3>Selected Research Projects —— Boredom</h3>
      
      <h4>AR Cognitive Intervention for Boredom in Monitoring</h4>
      <img src="/assets/images/r3.jpg" alt="r3">
      <p>We tested whether a small AR cognitive intervention could make long, boring monitoring tasks feel less dull. The intervention reduced boredom without hurting performance, because it helped people stay mentally engaged rather than drifting into task-unrelated thoughts. In short, adding a light cognitive activity helped operators call up their attention resources, making top-down monitoring easier to sustain.</p>

      <h4>Boredom in Different Information-Processing Mechanisms in Prolonged Monitoring Tasks</h4>
      <img src="/assets/images/r2.jpg" alt="r2">
      <p>We examined how boredom affects prospective memory during long monitoring tasks under top-down vs. bottom-up processing. The results showed that prospective memory became worse in top-down conditions, even though the brain was actually working harder to compensate. That is, when people are bored, top-down monitoring demands more internal attention, while bottom-up cues remain easier to detect, revealing different cognitive strategies behind the two mechanisms.</p>

      <h4>Cognitive Behaviors of Boredom in Intelligent Workplaces</h4>
      <img src="/assets/images/r1.jpg" alt="r1">
      <p><br>We used EEG to examine how boredom interferes with prospective memory during long, low-engagement tasks. The findings showed that boredom disrupts attention stability, and this disruption appears in the brain as changes in parietal and parieto-occipital alpha activity, which are linked to cue detection and visual processing. Results suggest that when people are bored, their brains drift toward internal thoughts, making it harder to notice and act on future intentions.</p>

      <h3>Selected Research Projects —— Music Creation</h3>
       <h4>Trend of C-Pop (2001-2017)</h4>
       <img src="/assets/images/r4.jpg" alt="r4">
      <p><br>We applied unsupervised and supervised learning on 4,805 Chinese pop songs (2001–2017), using spectrogram-based features (timbre, rhythm, pitch, mode) to uncover musical patterns. The analysis showed that lyricism and implicit emotional expression—music that feels gentle, relatable, and close to everyday life—remained consistently preferred by listeners. Across the 17 years, timbre and rhythm were the most critical features shaping trends, revealing how cultural identity and listening habits subtly influence the evolution of Chinese pop music.</p>

      <h4>Copyright Consciousness in AI Music Creation</h4>
       <img src="/assets/images/r5.jpg" alt="r5">
      <p><br>We surveyed how programmers, end-users, and music producers think about copyright when music is created with different levels of AI involvement.
The results showed that people rely on different cues, such as creativity, economic incentive, tool property, and intelligence effort, to judge whether AI-generated music should be personal or public property. Across scenarios, the less human effort involved, the more people tended to see AI music as public domain, highlighting a growing gap between human authorship and machine autonomy in creative work.</p>
